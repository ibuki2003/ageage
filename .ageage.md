# AGEAGE Project Summary

## About Project
- AGEAGE (Agentic AI Code Generation tool) is a project to generate code using AI agents.
- Built with Deno runtime, TypeScript, and integrates with OpenAI API.
- Supports interactive and CLI prompt modes for code generation tasks.
- Uses modular architecture consisting of agents, tools, filters, and configuration.
- Agents manage the process and can call tools (e.g., file read, find, grep, git commands) or child agents.
- Tools provide utility commands accessible by agents for code-related operations.
- Configuration is YAML based, allowing customization of agents, tools, and filters.
- Core components include an OpenAI adapter, agent runner, tool executor, and output printer.

## Repo Map
- `src/agent/`: Agent logic, including main agent runner and various built-in tools.
- `src/adapters/openai.ts`: Adapter for OpenAI API communication.
- `src/config.ts`: Configuration loader and schema definitions.
- `src/filters/`: Text filters for editing files.
- `src/main.ts`: Main CLI entry point, handles argument parsing, config loading, and running agents.
- `src/output.ts`: Output management and printing.
- `config.default.yaml`: Default configuration file.
- `.env` and config files: Environment and user configuration files.

## Others
- Uses deno standard libraries for YAML parsing, CLI argument parsing, dotenv, and logging.
- Supports extensible tool and agent system to manage coding tasks with AI.

# Config Structure Summary

## About Config Structure
- The configuration uses YAML format with defaults defined in `config.default.yaml`.
- `src/config.ts` contains the Config interface defining the full schema and functions to load and validate config.
- The main config fields include:
  - `default_agent`: The default agent name to use.
  - `agents`: Dictionary of agent configurations by name.
  - `tools`: Descriptions and settings for built-in tools.
  - `filters`: Settings for text editing filters.
  - `context_files`: Additional context files for prompts.

## Key Configurable Items
- `models`: Defines models used (e.g. OpenAI's o3, o4-mini).
- `agents`: Each agent has model assignment, description, prompt, tools, and child agents.
- `tools`: Tool descriptions and options, e.g. grep line limit.
- `filters`: Filter settings like trigger words and instructions.
- `context_files`: List of files loaded for prompt context.

## When to Update Long-term Memory
- When new CLI flags or configuration keys are added, removed, or changed.
- When public APIs or function/class signatures change that impact config.
- When major module or file structure changes affect configuration.
- When project-wide design decisions or coding conventions related to config change.
