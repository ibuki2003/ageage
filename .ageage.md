# AGEAGE Project Summary

## About Project
- AGEAGE (Agentic AI Code Generation tool) is a project to generate code using AI agents.
- Built with Deno runtime, TypeScript, and integrates with OpenAI API.
- Supports interactive and CLI prompt modes for code generation tasks.
- Uses modular architecture consisting of agents, tools, filters, and configuration.
- Agents manage the process and can call tools (e.g., file read, find, grep, git commands) or child agents.
- Tools provide utility commands accessible by agents for code-related operations.
- Configuration is YAML based, allowing customization of agents, tools, and filters.
- Core components include an OpenAI adapter, agent runner, tool executor, and output printer.

## Repo Map
- `src/agent/`: Agent logic, including main agent runner and various built-in tools.
- `src/adapters/openai.ts`: Adapter for OpenAI API communication.
- `src/config.ts`: Configuration loader and schema definitions.
